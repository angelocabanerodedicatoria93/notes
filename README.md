  if you need inspiring words, don't do it
  take risk
  never give up
  really like what you do
tony robbins
  don't be so hard on your self
  theres time
  if you give yourself just a little bit of time and
  if you be a little more loving to yourself
  you got a lot to give
  you gonna take the time to fully develop
sadhguru
  you will do something hard only because you don't know how to do it
  if you know how to do it, you would do it with ease
  without learning how to do something, if you try to do it, lifes becomes struggle
muhammad ali
  I must be the greatest

gary vaynerchuk
  one life
  stop caring what people think
  if anybody ever did it, then you can too

stay calm under pressure & under stress
 i'm excited
 slow is smooth, smooth is fast
 take a deep breath
 relax
 be grateful
 silent
 take a break

 remain positive
 avoid caffeine
 make jokes
 make a plan
 get some sleep
 ask for help
 mentally prepare

```
