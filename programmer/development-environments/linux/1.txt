Linux is nothing but a UNIX clone which is written Linus Torvalds from scratch with the help of some hackers across the globe.

Unix and Unix-like operating systems are a family of computer operating systems that derive from the original Unix System from Bell Labs which can be traced back to 1965. 

Linux is the most popular variant and there comes in a number of different distributions.

Unix is a family of multitasking, portable, multi-user computer operating systems, which also have time-sharing configurations.

Unix systems use a centralized OS kernel which is responsible for managing the entire system.

The programming interface, file abstraction, built-in networking and persistent background processing called daemons are the other features and capabilities that are supported by a Unix OS.
